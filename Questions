1. Do I have to add something to have a good RL agent?
2. How do I make the training with this simulator?
3. Do I start by defining the MDP (Markov Decision Process)?
4. What do you need to follow the thesis ? (i.e. Github for instance)
5. Have you got any advice or tutorial to follow to start coding the agent in Python
